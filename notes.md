ASANA BOARD DISCUSSIONS
------------------------
### Purpose of Research
Search or Coverage or xxxxxxx
I think main purpose of the research is task allocation between multiple agents
How different theories(bid, voronoi, random, radial) would perform in order to cover a region fully in an unknown space?
### What is the scope of inter robot communication and map communication?
Here will be the assumptions regarding inter robot communication and map communication:
- No GPS available inside of the buildings
- Each agent knows its location. While it moves, 

### Will we do a hardware set?
No. Main purpose of the research will be focusing on comparing different versions of area exploration methods
### Will we do a robotic simulation?
We do not need that since the paper will be mostly algorithmic and will be focusing on comparing the success of different methods.
### Will we run this in a continuous environment or grid based world?
From my perspective, we should continue working with the grid space but eventually design and test this system with the continuous environment as well before we do the hardware tests.
